You now want to make your model look nice and have the true(ish) colour texture of the real thing. Generally in this museum, everything is white, off-white or yellowy-white. So don't expect wonders!

Follow these steps to create your texture:

1. You got it, click **Workflow**
2. Choose Generic, Mosaic (default) and 4096 x 1 in the options window as shown below.<br />
![The photoscan window]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/texture.jpg "Photoscan interface window")

3. Wait for the texture generation to finish. And you might see something like this.<br />

![The photoscan window]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/finished.jpg "Photoscan interface window")

Et voila, you have created a 3D model. You are amazing.
