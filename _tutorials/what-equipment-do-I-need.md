Today, we will just be covering the very basics of photogrammetry and not delving into best practise for most accurate representations. You will be learning how to take images without special equipment, which will not compromise the conservation and physical integrity of an object.

So today, you will need just:

* A device capable of taking digital photos. You can use a compact camera, a DSLR or a mobile phone
* A way of transferring your photos to a computer
* A computer that has at least 8MB of RAM (Apple, PC)
* A subject to scan
* A copy of Photoscan standard (demo or unlocked) - there are other packages, but today we will use this.

If we were going for fully professional level scanning with this process we would add to this list:

* Tripod or pole
* Tethered shooting for a camera to laptop
* Lighting
* Scale bars 
* Colour charts
* Targets to aid photo alignment
* Turntable for small objects
* A lightbox
* A range of filters (polarising etc)

But, we're not **today**! We're just learning the basic process.
