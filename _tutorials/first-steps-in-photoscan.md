I am now assuming you have taken your photographs and have them on SD card and are ready to transfer them onto your computer for processing. 

We are going to use one of the industry's best packages for photogrammetry, which does not need a high end graphics card. This package is called Photoscan and is made by Agisoft. You will need to download the [standard version](http://www.agisoft.com/downloads/installer/) and apply for a **[demo key](http://www.agisoft.com/downloads/installer/#)**. 

I have a copy on a memory stick if you cannot get online. 

Once installed you are ready to go. Open the Photoscan package and you will see this interface appear. Sort of scary? It is pretty simple to use, just follow the instructions over the next few pages.

We are going to do several steps now:

1. Align photos
2. Create a dense cloud
3. Clean the dense cloud
4. Create a mesh (that's the solid shape of the object)
5. Add a texture
6. Upload it to Sketchfab
