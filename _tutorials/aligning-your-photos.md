Now you have got Photoscan open, you are ready to go. Your first step is to assemble your overlapping images into a sparse point cloud - matching points that will appear in a 3 dimensional grid on XYZ planes. 

This is very easy. Follow these steps:

1. Download all your images into a folder on your computer (I have an SD card reader and various cables)
2. Now go to Photoscan and click *Workflow* on the top menu
3. Choose Add Folder
4. Navigate to the folder you wish to use and click open
5. In the dialogue window, choose 'Create camera from each file' and press ok (see image below.)

Your images will now appear in the left hand pane under workspace as 'CHUNK 1'. 

Now you are ready to align. As we're doing this as a very quick demo. We will use the low setting for all of the steps from here until texture creation. 

Alignment can now happen!

1. Click *Workflow
2. Choose * Align photos* 
3. Have 'Generic preselection' ticked
4. Set accuracy as low
5. Press OK

This will then bring up a countdown timer. Have patience, this will take time to process. Go off and see some casts. When time is meant to have finished come back and we are at the next stage.
