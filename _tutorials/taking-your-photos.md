We are now ready to begin our photography session. You have learnt the basics of how to take the photographs.
In this session, I would like you to remain on automatic settings and retain the same focal length for all photos.

Now remember the steps:

* 3 circuits - high, low, middle
* 10/15 degree increments as you step around the object (make sure you do not have risk of bumping into things)
* 60% overlap in your images

Away you go!
