We now need to think about how we will take photographs of the object that you have chosen. Factors we need to consider are:

## Photography conditions:

In an ideal world, your object would be still and lit well. You're in a museum, guerilla scanning (i.e. not fully kitted up and without permits and a gallery clear of visitors), so it is very likely you may have sub-optimal conditions. Today, the weather forecast is overcast, which should make the gallery's natural light work quite well. 

## Camera usage

You will no doubt ask me how many photographs you will need to take for the object you have chosen. This varies generally, but for today's exercise, we will be following this method. We will do:

* 3 circuits of the sculpture - oblique from above, middle and from below
* Take photographs that overlap by approximately 60% in each image at around 10-15 degrees angle of movement each time. 

This excellent visualisation from Thomas Flynn of Sketchfab is very useful here.
