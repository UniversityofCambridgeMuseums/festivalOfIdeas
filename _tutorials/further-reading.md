Thank you for coming to my workshop and interacting with University of Cambridge Museums. I hope you will now go out and create great 3D. This is a very basic tutorial session and there are far more things to learn. 

If you would like to learn more, I suggest the following reading:

## Charters, training and metadata standards

## Raw data to practise with

I have a large folder on [Google Drive](https://goo.gl/CS5aoN) with hundreds of GB of data for various models. You could use this for practise.
